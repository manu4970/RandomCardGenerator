# RandomCardGenerator

# 📝 Instructions

Create an algorithm that randomly builds a card on every refresh:

1. Every time the website refreshes a new random card needs to show.

2. The card must have one of the possible suits: Hearts, Spades, Clubs and Diamonds.

3. The card value must be one of the following: 2 to 10, King, Queen, Jack or Ace, (no joker).

In the end, the project needs to look similar to [this demo](https://github.com/breatheco-de/exercise-random-card/blob/master/preview.gif?raw=true).
